# customTaoDeliveryRdf

Custom version of taoDeliveryRdf with REST Api for supervision

## Installation

This extension replaces the `taoDeliveryRdf` extension. Hence you must rename this directory `taoDeliveryRdf` and put it in place of the original one in the TAO root directory.

Be careful! The `www-data` user must have the read rights on the PHP session folder (which can be obtained with the `session_save_path()` command) to allow the supervision.
